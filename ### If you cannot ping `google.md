### If you cannot ping `google.com` after attempting to connect to Wi-Fi in recovery mode, it could indicate several potential issues. Here's a troubleshooting guide to help you diagnose and fix the problem:

### Steps to Diagnose

1. **Check Wi-Fi Connection Status**

   First, verify that the `wpa_supplicant` process connected to the Wi-Fi network successfully. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   iwconfig
   ```

   This should display the network details if connected, including the ESSID (network name) and signal strength.

   If `iwconfig` doesn't show the ESSID or displays `Not-Associated`, the Wi-Fi connection may have failed. Double-check your `wpa_supplicant.conf` for the correct SSID and password.

2. **Check for an IP Address**

   Confirm whether your system received an IP address from the network. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   ip addr show wlan0
   ```

   Look for a line starting with `inet`. If there's no IP address assigned, try running `dhclient` again:

   ```bash
   dhclient wlan0
   ```

   If this fails, there may be an issue with DHCP or the Wi-Fi connection itself.

3. **Test Connectivity by IP Address**

   If you have an IP address but cannot ping `google.com`, it may be a DNS issue. Try pinging Google's public DNS server by its IP address:

   ```bash
   ping 8.8.8.8
   ```

   If this works, it means your network connection is fine, but there's a DNS resolution issue.

4. **Check DNS Configuration**

   If pinging by IP works but domain names don't resolve, you need to configure your DNS settings. Edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to add Google's DNS server manually:

   ```bash
   nano /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   ```

   Save and exit (`CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `Enter`).

   After this, try pinging `google.com` again.

5. **Check for Hardware or Driver Issues**

   If none of the above steps work, there might be a problem with your wireless drivers or hardware. Try verifying that the correct drivers are loaded for your Wi-Fi card:

   ```bash
   lshw -C network
   ```

   Look for the section related to the Wi-Fi interface and check if there are any issues or missing drivers.

### Summary

- If you **can't connect to the Wi-Fi network**, recheck your network configuration.
- If you're connected but **can't ping IPs** (like `8.8.8.8`), the problem may be with DHCP or driver issues.
- If you can ping IPs but **can't ping domain names**, it's a DNS issue.
