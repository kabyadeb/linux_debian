Connecting to a Wi-Fi network in recovery mode on Ubuntu involves a few steps using the command line. Here’s how to do it:

### 1. Boot into Recovery Mode

1. Restart your computer.
2. Hold the `Shift` key after the BIOS/UEFI screen to access the GRUB menu.
3. Select "Advanced options for Ubuntu" and then choose the recovery mode option.

### 2. Drop to Root Shell

- From the recovery menu, select "root" to access a root shell.

### 3. Identify Your Wireless Interface

- Check your network interfaces:
  ```
  ip a
  ```
- Look for an interface that resembles `wlan0` or similar.It may differ in different computer

### 4. Install `wpa_supplicant` (if necessary)

- If `wpa_supplicant` isn’t available, you might need to install it. However, installation in recovery mode is limited. You might need to ensure it's already present in your normal installation.

### 5. Create a Configuration File for Wi-Fi

- Create a configuration file for your Wi-Fi network:
  ```
  nano /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
  ```
- Add the following lines, replacing `your_SSID` and `your_password` with your network details:
  ```plaintext
  network={
      ssid="your_SSID"
      psk="your_password"
  }
  ```
- Save and exit (in `nano`, use `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).
