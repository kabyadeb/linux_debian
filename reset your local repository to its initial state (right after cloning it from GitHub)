 To reset your local repository to its initial state (right after cloning it from GitHub), you can follow these steps:

### 1. Discard all changes (unstaged and staged)

If you want to discard all the changes made to the files in your repository, use the following command:

```
git reset --hard
```
This will reset all tracked files to their latest state in the current branch.
### 2. Clean untracked files (if you added any new files)

If you've created new files or directories that are not tracked by Git, you can remove them with:
```
git clean -fd
```
- `f:` Force deletion of untracked files.
- `d:` Remove untracked directories as well.
### 3. Ensure you're on the correct branch

If you're not on the branch you originally cloned, switch to it:
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```
Replace <branch-name> with the branch you cloned, usually main or master.
### 4.  Pull from the remote repository (optional)

- If you suspect your local branch is outdated compared to the remote branch, fetch and reset to match the remote:
```
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>
```
### 5. Verify your repository status

Finally, check the repository status to ensure it's clean:
```
git status
```
- It should display:
`nothing to commit, working tree clean`
